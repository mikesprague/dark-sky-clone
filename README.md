## About :information_source:

Sky Dark is an open source <abbr title="Progressive Web Application">PWA</abbr> built
as an homage to the now defunct Dark Sky for Android app.

### WIP (work in progress) :construction:

Please note that this is a work in progress and is NOT an exact replica in functionality
or design. I built it mainly to learn a few things and because the Dark Sky for
Android app used to be my daily driver and I missed the experience.
